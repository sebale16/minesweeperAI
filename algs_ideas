number 1: (in pseudocode)

initialize the empty mine grid.
bombs_found = 0
while bombs_found <= 10:
loop through every tile in the inner grid (in blue):
if tile is at 1:
			check through all its 8 surrounding mine board tiles
			if no marked tiles:
				if only one unopened (5) tile in its 8 surrounding tiles:
					set mine board tile to 1
					bombs_found += 1
			else:
				if more than one unopened tile:
					open all the unmarked tiles.
			change board map appropriately
			click on tiles
		if tile is at 2-4 (n):
check through all its 8 surrounding mine board tiles
if marked tiles < unopened tiles:
		continue (nothing to be done)
elif marked tiles == unopened tiles:
		set n tiles to 1 on bomb map
		bombs_found += 1
